    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My name is Niall Carroll, and I am based in Galway, Ireland. Although I am an aspiring web developer, I currently work as an
        organist and choir director. I am highly motivated and enthusiastic, always setting new goals for myself and the choirs with which I work. 
        Never afraid of a challenge, I decided to take some introductory courses in web development - I leapt right in and found that I really enjoyed seeing 
        my coding coming to life. My hope is that, in time, I will be able to work full-time in the area of software development.
